About this Project
==================

This project is part of my solution to the interview question at JP Morgan Chase Bank. 

Build and Run the Executables
=============================

The project has been developed in Java using plain text editor and command-line tools. BASH script tools are employed to build and execute the code. (Details to be completed). I expect the project to be easily imported to an or build toolchains if needed.
